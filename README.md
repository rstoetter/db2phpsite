# db2phpsite
Do you want to move your database to the Web without programming a dedicated application? Do you want to create a Web application without coding? Then you need a database application builder such as db2phpsite. db2phpsite is much more than a form builder: it's a piece of software which makes the creation of PHP online database applications easy and fast.

No coding is required: If you have a MySQL database you can create a basic CRUDL (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List large data sets) database front-end in minutes. 

Moreover the PHP CLI application db2phpsite is highly configurable: You may, but do not need to configure the generation of the code via a script file and you can customize the generated object oriented PHP code easily in order to build a more sophisticated database application.
